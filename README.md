# Java DFA Lexer
A simple educational example of a lexer (scanner) implementation for Java using a DFA.
The transition function (the DFA rules along with the states) is progressively added to the DFA. (a bit space inefficient but it's quite good to get a grasp on some of the concepts).
Should in theory be able to scan most of the tokens encountered in a Java source file.
Generics are excluded.
